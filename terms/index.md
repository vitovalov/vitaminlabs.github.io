## Disclosure Policy

We make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help support this website because We'll get a percentage of that sale.

Currently we're an affiliate for Google Adsense.

What this means for you:

* We do not and will not recommend a product just because we're an affiliate.
* We became an affiliate to earn some revenue towards the costs of running and maintaining this website. Where We have direct control over which ads are served on this website We offer only products that are directly related to the topic of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a genuine interest in or need of.
* We do not recommend products just for the sake of making money.
* We recommend products because We think they are valuable to our readers.
* We do not let the compensation We receive influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.
* We respect and value our readers too much to write anything other than our own genuine and objective opinions and advice.

Just like this website, our Disclosure Policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.
